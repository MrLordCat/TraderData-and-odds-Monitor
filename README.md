# OddsMoni Desktop (Prototype)

Minimal Electron-based desktop application for monitoring sports betting odds and integrating a League of Legends statistics / stream helper module.

Fonts used: Inter (variable + regular/semi-bold fallback) with system fallbacks (system-ui, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Arial). Font files are git-ignored — only the CSS references remain.

## What it does (current / planned core capabilities)
- Open multiple bookmaker (broker) sites in managed BrowserViews
- Inject extraction scripts to scrape live odds
- Normalize & display odds in a compact dashboard UI
- Collect and show League of Legends match statistics (LoL stats module)
- Provide a convenient layout for watching streams alongside data panels


This README intentionally kept short for now. More developer & build details will be added later.
